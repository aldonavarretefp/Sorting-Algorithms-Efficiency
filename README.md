# Sorting-Algorithms-Efficiency
In this project, I compare 7  of the Sorting algorithms that I learned at 2* Semester of the Faculty.

## Quicksort
###### Best case, Average case O(nlogn)
###### Worst case O(n^2)
This algorithm mainly does the strategy called 'Divide & Conquer', choosing a pivot, 
and grouping in two sides, the left ones that are the ones smaller than the pivot, and
the right ones, which are greater than the pivot. In this exercise I decided to make it recursively.
